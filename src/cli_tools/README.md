# Smart Exam Format - CLI Interface

The `cli_interface` folder contains command-line tools for interacting with **Smart Exam Format (SEF)** files.

## About the CLI Tools

These tools allow users to load, parse, and manipulate SEF files directly from the command line. Typical operations include displaying questions and answers, marking selections, and exporting results.
