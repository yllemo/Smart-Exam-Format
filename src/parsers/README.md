# Smart Exam Format - Parsers

The `parsers` folder contains scripts for parsing and processing `.txt` files written in the **Smart Exam Format (SEF)**.

## About the Parsers

These scripts read SEF files and parse questions, answers, correct answers, and user selections. The parsers ensure each SEF file adheres to the formatâ€™s standards and produce structured data for use in other applications, such as simulators and analyzers.

**Supported Languages**: Python, JavaScript, C#
